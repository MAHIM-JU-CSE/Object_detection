# cvlib
A simple, high level, easy-to-use open source Computer Vision library for Python.

## Installation

### Installing dependencies

Provided the below python packages are installed, cvlib is completely pip installable.

* OpenCV
* TensorFlow

If you don't have them already installed, you can install through pip

`pip install opencv-python tensorflow` 


### Installing cvlib

`pip install cvlib`

To upgrade to the newest version
`pip install --upgrade cvlib`


**Note: Compatability with Python 2.x is not officially tested.**


## Object detection
Detecting common objects in the scene is enabled through a single function call `detect_common_objects()`. It will return the bounding box co-ordinates, corrensponding labels and confidence scores for the detected objects in the image.

### Example :

```python
import cvlib as cv
from cvlib.object_detection import draw_bbox

bbox, label, conf = cv.detect_common_objects(img)

output_image = draw_bbox(img, bbox, label, conf)
```
Underneath it uses [YOLOv4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) model trained on [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/) capable of detecting 80 [common objects](https://github.com/arunponnusamy/object-detection-opencv/blob/master/yolov3.txt) in context.
